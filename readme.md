This was built to test the concept of using a simple quiz-based interface to educate users on fake news, and also collect data on where pockets of disinformation spread. 

The questions were framed in an irreverent tone, to make the experience fun. The options listed some real and some common misperceptions and some flat-out fake news.

The user would submit some basic demographic info, without name/email, and this would help us determine where the echo chambers around specific false information was being developed (eg if all users from a certain age/race/class group got the same wrong answer, we could deduce that this demographic space was sharing something that perpetuated the misperception).

The experiment was stopped after 6 months as it was onerous to generate new quizzes. An automatic headline scraping tool to generate questions would have been better, but difficult to design.
